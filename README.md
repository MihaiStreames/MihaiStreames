Hey there :3

I'm a Computer Science student who likes cybersecurity, software development, and *recently* figured out I also like networking. If something piques my interest, I'll find the time to learn about it.

*Support me on ko-fi if you like the stuff I make so that I can drink more coffee while programming :)*

- **Python** - have been using it for years now, my brain is plagued by this language (especially its "threading")
- **Rust** - currently learning, slowly replacing Python for things that need to actually work
- **C/C++** - i can never find interesting projects *(windows apps coming soon via [@Thin32](https://github.com/Thin32))*
- **Lua** - specifically Luau, from my roblox  dev days
- **Java** - decent at it thanks to university, Spring Boot makes it bearable
- **(Java)TypeScript + Svelte** - the only frontend stack that makes sense

*I'm not listing C# (used it once, awful) or every other language I've touched.*
